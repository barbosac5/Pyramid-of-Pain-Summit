# Starting Sample 4
As I ascend through the Pyramid of Pain by implementing defenses, I am causing Sphinx more trouble since they will need to go to greater lengths to gain unauthorized access to PicoSecure systems and data. 
Lengths include purchasing and registering new domains, which can be costly to most adversaries. A new sample was sent, and I am now required to find any changes made by the malware (artifacts) on the victim’s system. 
To see changes, I will first need to generate a report on the new malware and identify any suspicious behavior caused by the malware execution on the host system. Based on the screenshot below, behaviors marked as “Malicious” 
include the Process ID (PID) 3806, which turns off Windows Defender Real-time monitoring.

# How to Complete Sample 4
As part of the fourth level of the Pyramid of Pain, I must create a new rule to focus on this malicious behavior. I first created a new rule to focus on System Activity Logs (Sysmon Event Logs). I then select the Registry Modifications value, 
which searches for and identifies any system changes or configurations within PicoSecure systems. Finally, I input the registry key, name, and Value from the Sample4.exe report. I need to input the correct Adversary Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge 
(ATT&CK) option as Defense Evasion since the malware aims to disable Windows Defender, a primary detection method.
