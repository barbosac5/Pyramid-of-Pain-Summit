# Start of Sample 3
After stopping Sphinx again, a third malware sample (sample3.exe) was sent along with an update that blocking through IP addresses would no longer be feasible. Sphinx has pivoted to a cloud service provider, 
leading to the accessibility of more public IP addresses. Utilizing a cloud service provider requires some investment (the "pain"), but it is not impossible to be set up with hundreds of public IPs upon signing up. For example, 
it is manageable for some adversaries, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). To continue the exercise, I will need to come up with a new solution to stop the following malware sample.


#  Completing Sample 3
To thwart Sphinx, I must utilize the next level of the Pyramid of Pain, which consists of domains under use. Like with the previous samples, I ran a report on sample3.exe and checked for any unusual domains that can be associated with the adversary. 
I could find the connections made by sample3 and a backdoor executable connecting to the domain "emudyn.bresonicz.info".  To complete this step, I must block the Domain in question by taking advantage of PicoSecure's DNS Filter and creating a new DNS rule. 
For this rule, I name it "Block sample3.exe" for simplicity's sake. Since the executable is a form of Malware, the category is Malware, the domain name is the Domain found within the sample3 report ("emudyn.bresonicz.info"), and the action is set as "Deny" 
to prevent sample3 from connecting to Sphinx's C2 server.
