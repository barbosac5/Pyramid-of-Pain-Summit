# Sample 6
With almost all adversary methods blocked, Sphinx has one last attack, sample 6, covering explicitly their technique and procedures (how they think and act when they have gained unauthorized access). 
Their commands can be seen within a log file (commands.log), which shows Sphinxs' actions once they access a victim's machine.

# Rule generation to block sample6.exe
One last rule must be created using the Rule Binder to thwart this final attempt. By focusing on Sysmon Events, I need to target events involving File Creation and Modification. For Step 3: 
I need to fill in the following information using the log file provided for sample 6. This includes the File Path (input as %temp%), the File Name (exfiltrate.log), and lastly, the ATT&CK ID (Collection). 
Once the rule is validated, the simulation is over with Sphinx giving up, and all the levels of the Pyramid of Pain are exercised.
