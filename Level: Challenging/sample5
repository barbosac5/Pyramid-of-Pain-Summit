# Sample 5 start
With sample 4 successfully blocked, many attackers would have given up due to many not having the resources and time investment to continue pushing onward. However, this is a collaborative scenario where sample 5 
requires a new detection method. The goal is to find something abnormal about the tool's behavior and configure a rule to detect it. The outgoing_connections.log file has been provided to me so I can discover the pattern.

# Sample 5 method
First, I analyze the log to see if I can uncover a pattern indicating malicious behavior. While there are spikes in the size (bytes) of data going to Sphinx (which looks like data exfiltration), 
there are also logs showing 97 bytes. To detect the sample, I will need to configure a new rule utilizing the same tool used within sample 4, the Sigma Rule Binder. For Step 1, I create a new rule focusing on Sysmon Event 
Logs and then target Network Connections as the Event I want to focus on, since the log file shows connections made with the victim machine over multiple IP addresses. Finally, for Step 3, I input the necessary information to 
configure the new rule. For Remote IP, the attacker utilized many different IPs to invest in a cloud service provider (many public IPs), so I input 'Any'. Remote ports, I again input 'Any' since the C2 activity occurs through several ports. 
For the file size, I input 97 bytes. The frequency of the logs is about every 30 minutes, so I input a 30-minute frequency in seconds (1800 seconds). For the ATT&CK ID, I input Command and Control, the data exfiltration includes 
the  exfiltration (through a large amount of bytes that exit the victim system) and the 97 bytes look to be some "downtime" before the next instruction from the C2 server.
